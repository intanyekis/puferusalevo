Since when do janitors get to be involved and see the outcome of a dna test??? and when does a dna test get to be done without telling the mother(taylor?) and another thing! (lol) when bridgette was going in the delivery room and on the phone with her mother saying 'theres something wrong with the heartbeat!" isnt that privileged and private information??? too unrealistic. shes acting like someone who never went to medical school or read the HEPA laws. grrrrr irritates me!!</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>sally2</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>October 16, 2007, 10:58pm <span itemprop=position>11</span></span><p>I love the CARL character , creepy , NO …Geeky , YES !<br>we all grew up knowing “A CARL” somewhere in our past .<br>His character has the potential for some serious fun , while moving through the rich and famous crowd .

Bridget needs a new guy. Maybe he will show up at her door one day and be a totally new man. (After the Forrester make-over suggested earlier.)</p><p>I just don’t get Carl. Or Bridget with him. Why would a doctor turn her back as the janitor read test results to her? Wouldn’t she want to see them? Why does she trust him so much?</p><p>:)) I get a kick out of Carl too. He adds a little comedy to the show. I can’t see Carl & Bridget being together either - but he is funny pursuing her!</p><p>The Kiss was going over the top especially another hospital employee walking in, he grabs her and acted like the other doctor entering the room needed to rent his own room. Sooo unrealistic. Bridgett should have slapped him into next week. He would have been so fired the first time he broke patient privacy and confidentiality. Now he is busted kissing a doctor? He is creepy, but smarter than he appears, I think he did the switcharoo thing just to get closer to Bridgett.</p><p>Wow a lot of lives to mess with just for a date or a glance in his direction. This s/l with Carl might end up surprising us all, I sure hope so because it seems to be going no where right now. That is an interesting point about the DNA matching Brooke if it is Bridgetts child but the percentage would show less making it inpossible but hey’ the janitor and the doctor story is a little out there too.</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>berte</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>October 17, 2007, 1:11pm <span itemprop=position>16</span></span><p>I think Carl whose ability extends beyond being a janitor.
