Wrestling is probably what gave rise to other forms of combat, including martial arts and different forms of unarmed fighting. WWE is the world's most successful wrestling entertainment brand and the largest wrestling promotion company in the world.</p><p>The popularity of wrestling and WWE has given rise to a group of wrestling superstars, who are in every way some of the toughest wrestlers in the United States and a few other countries. These superstars are just like the movie stars and music idols&nbsp;because they are just as famous as they are and some earn as much as or even more than some movie stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like other celebrities, the WWE superstars hardly have a private life, because their fans want to know everything about them. This list is about the women that the top WWE superstars are dating or are married to. The interesting thing is that most of the current superstars got married in the recent past, and those who are still dating are too few. Another interesting thing is that all of these superstars are dating or are married to women who are out of their league, women who are so beautiful that one would wonder if all the hot girls are attracted to wrestlers.</p><p>Here is a list of the current superstars and the unbelievable women in their lives.</p><h2 id=15-brock-lesnar-and-sable><strong>15. Brock Lesnar and Sable</strong></h2><p>Sable might be a retired professional wrestler and possibly one of the older women on this list, but that hardly means that she is any less hotter than the other women on this list. Sable is turning 50 this year, and she got married to <a href=#>Brock Lesnar</a> ten years ago. Just to prove how hot Sable was and still is, most women get married to older men, but Sable got married to a man ten years her junior and she does not look a year older than he does. Sable still looks like a model, she is an actress, and is one of the all-time best retired female wrestlers. Unlike most WWE wives and girlfriends who have never appeared on the cover of Playboy, Sable has made three appearances so far and she is still hot enough to make another appearance. Sable is clearly out of Lesnar's league, regardless of being older and more mature than he is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-goldberg-and-wanda-ferraton><strong>14. Goldberg and Wanda Ferraton</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Goldberg</a> is one of those wrestling superstars, who everybody loves&nbsp;because he is not only one of the best wrestlers in the industry, he is a good man in every sense of the word. Although Goldberg is still a wrestler with WWE, albeit a semi-retired wrestler, we remember him most from his time in WCW. His lengthy undefeated streak is one of the most memorable things about Goldberg, in addition to his strength, powerful moves, and quick thinking. Goldberg is married to Wanda Ferraton, a very beautiful woman who became wife almost 12 years ago, with whom he has a son called Gage. Wanda has a very beautiful face and a very attractive smile, a combination that is enough to melt any man's heart. When couples have been together for so long, the two start to think and act the same way and in most cases, they start to look the same. There is no way Goldberg will ever look as hot as Wanda, but he can always boast in the fact that he married a woman who was and still is out of his league.</p><h2 id=13-undertaker-and-michelle-mccool><strong>13. Undertaker and Michelle McCool</strong></h2><p>It is hard to imagine that The <a href=#>Undertaker</a> has a family, let alone a very attractive wife that loves him to bits. The Undertaker's role in the WWE is that of striking fear into people - not only his opponents, but also with the fans who do not really understand him. In recent years the Undertaker is loved by most, if not all the WWE fans because, unlike in the past, he is one of the good guys and is definitely one of the longest serving superstars in this business. Loving the Undertaker to the point of marrying him requires a woman to look deep inside and ignore or even enjoy his death-themed acts on WWE. Despite tying the knot many years ago, the Undertaker and McCool look good together and their relationship is one that many wrestlers should emulate. Looking at McCool you will immediately figure out just how out of Undertaker's league she is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-triple-h-and-stephanie-mcmahon><strong>12. Triple H and Stephanie McMahon</strong></h2><p>It is very common for people to hate the boss as well as his children, which is one of the reasons <a href=#>Stephanie</a> might not have as many fans as she deserves. However, even with the haters, Stephanie is still one of the hottest women in WWE and she is undoubtedly out of <a href=#>Triple H</a>'s league in every way. Stephanie is not only a model and a bodybuilder; she is a businesswoman, a professional wrestling valet, and a part-time professional wrestler, who has had great success over the years. Since Stephanie is WWE's Chief Brand Officer, she makes a lot more money than Triple H does. Although these two started their relationship on TV as part of a script, Triple H wasted no time in marrying her even in real-life, because he knew that she was, and still is, a treasure worth keeping forever.</p><h2 id=11-kevin-owens-and-karina-steen><strong>11. Kevin Owens and Karina Steen</strong></h2><p>The amazing thing about this couple is that these two have been married for ten years, and they look so fresh you would think that they are newlyweds. Kevin Owens is a really nice guy and the majority of people like him, although even the best of them still have haters. The fact that Kevin is the reigning and longest serving WWE Universal Champion in his first reign is amazing - a fact that goes to show that he is good at what he does. Kevin adores his wife, who is his number one fan, but as soon as you lay eyes on her, you will become her number one fan. Karina is one of those extremely beautiful women whose humility makes her even more beautiful. This woman has amazingly long hair, a very beautiful face, and a gorgeous body. Here, there is no doubt about how out of Kevin's league Karina is&nbsp;since Kevin is definitely a good guy but Karina belongs to the super-hot category.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-luke-gallows-and-amber-o-neal><strong>10. Luke Gallows and Amber O'Neal</strong></h2><p>Yes, whether you want to believe it or not, Luke Gallows and Amber O'Neal are together and they have been married close to three years now. This is probably one of the couples on this list where no one needs convincing as to how high up Amber is in comparison to her husband. However, since beauty is in the eye of the beholder, we cannot question Amber's decision to date Luke, since she has to be madly in love with him and him with her. Although you will never tell by looking, Amber is almost ten years older than Luke is, but she looks younger and amazing in every way. Amber is a professional wrestler in Ring of Honor (ROH)&nbsp;and is a former World Women's Champion. Since Amber is a motorcycle enthusiast and she loves motocross, we can start to understand why Luke must have swept her off her feet, given he looks just like a biker.</p><h2 id=9-the-miz-and-maryse-ouellet><strong>9. The Miz and Maryse Ouellet</strong></h2><p><a href=#>The Miz</a> is one of those wrestlers who feel as if they are too hot for this world, but that feeling is usually in such people's heads. One of the best things he ever did in his life was to date and even marry Maryse Ouellet, a woman so hot he is so lucky to have found her and stolen her heart. Maryse hails from Canada, and since her days as a professional wrestler are behind her, she specializes more in business, acting, and managing her husband. Just by looking at Maryse, you will immediately realize that she is a glamor model&nbsp;because her body is perfect and she can excite any man just by appearing in a photo. Back in 2003, as evidence of just how hot she is, Maryse actually became Miss Hawaiian Tropic Canada, a beauty contest that attracts some of the most gorgeous women in Canada.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-roman-reigns-and-galina-becker><strong>8. Roman Reigns and Galina Becker</strong></h2><p>Galina Becker might be married to&nbsp;<a href=#>Roman Reigns</a> but that does not mean that the two are in the same league. Roman Reigns might not be the worst looking guy in WWE, he might actually be one of the guys at the top of the list of good looking male wrestlers; however, Galina is still too hot for him. Although most wrestlers usually end up marrying fellow wrestlers or women with a close connection to WWE, Galina's background is in athletics. Looking at her, you need no convincing that she is very fit, and the fact that she is very beautiful just widens the gap between her league and Reigns' league. However, these two met even before Reigns went into professional wrestling, having met at Georgia Tech where Reigns was playing football and Galina was participating in track and field events. Although marriage brings two people together and unites them into one, there is no denying just how hot Galina is.</p><h2 id=7-rusev-and-lana><strong>7. Rusev and Lana</strong></h2><p>Lana is one of those women who are so hot it hurts, owing to the fact that everything about her is beautiful. Lana is without a doubt one of the most beautiful women in WWE, a claim that most WWE fans and wrestlers would support. The interesting thing here is that&nbsp;exactly one year ago, Lana was not yet married; she was dating Rusev, who eventually became her husband on July 29, 2016. Rusev might have the muscles and great hair but we cannot help but imagine how out of his league Lana is. Although Lana, whose real name is Catherine Joy "C.J." Perry, spent most of her childhood in Russia, she is actually an American, born in Gainesville, Florida. Just by looking at her, you can tell that she is a model and a dancer, although she is also a singer, an actress, a wrestler, and a professional wrestling manager.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-randy-orton-and-kimberly-kessler><strong>6. Randy Orton and Kimberly Kessler</strong></h2><p>This entry is a very close call because <a href=#>Randy</a> and Kim seem so perfect for each other. If WWE someday were to decide to promote families and relationships, chances are that Randy and Kim would be the couple on the poster. The couple dated for a while before getting married in November 2015, where they formed a huge family of seven&nbsp;since they got their first child together in November 2016 in addition to Randy's daughter and Kim's three sons. However, just like all the other couples on this list, Kim is slightly out of Randy's league despite being married to him. Kim was in love with Randy even before meeting him in person, although Randy was the one to gather the courage to approach her and ask her name. Kim is hot in every sense of the word and images of the two of them together are simply breathtaking.</p><h2 id=5-jack-swagger-and-catalina-white><strong>5. Jack Swagger and Catalina White</strong></h2><p>Are you one of those people who sit and wonder how and why things work out the way they do? If you are, then you are not alone because many people wonder how Jack Swagger could not only date one of the hottest women on the planet but also get her to marry him. This is the point every guy looks back at his life and wonders what is wrong with their life choices, because if Swagger could get Catalina, then they can all do better as well. Catalina is so hot that she has appeared in magazines such as the Complex Magazine, FHM, and Maxim, a clear indication that this model's beauty is uncommon. In addition to being a&nbsp;fitness, lifestyle, lingerie, and swimwear model, Catalina is a dancer, and an actress, professions you can only get into if you are super-hot. It would not even be necessary to point out just how Catalina is out of Swagger's league.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-big-cass-and-carmella><strong>4. Big Cass and Carmella</strong></h2><p>What is your definition of a wildly hot girl? Would your description of such a girl have traits such as model, dancer, personal trainer, gorgeous body, and can totally kick ass? Then you have just described Carmella, the girl who is apparently dating Big Cass. When you think of Big Cass and Carmella together, you cannot help but ask yourself how things work because Carmella should truly be dating a much hotter guy. Carmella's real name is Leah Van Dale. In addition to her description above, she is a professional wrestling manager, she holds a bachelor's degree in marketing from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, and she was part of the L.A Lakers dance team from 2010 through to 2011. Carmella and Big Cass have been dating for a while now and if everything goes according to their plan, they might actually get married. If Big Cass is wise, he will not waste any time marrying this beauty.</p><h2 id=3-john-cena-and-nikki-bella><strong>3. John Cena and Nikki Bella</strong></h2><p>This entry might cause some controversy because women all over the world would die to date <a href=#>John Cena</a>, but the truth is that Bella is still out of his league. Imagine a scenario where Cena and Bella are not famous, all of us would be asking what a hot girl like Bella was doing with Cena. Don’t get me wrong, Cena is one of the best-toned and masculine men in the WWE, and possibly the most popular with the ladies, but Bella is just something else. Her real name is Stephanie Nicole Garcia-Colace and in addition to being one of the most beautiful female wrestlers with a pretty face, she is an actress and a model who does not believe that there are barriers she cannot break. You might think that because at times Bella acts like a tomboy she would be less attractive, but that is one of her strong points. These two are yet to tie the knot officially but Cena seems not to be worried.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-buddy-murphy-and-alexa-bliss><strong>2. Buddy Murphy and Alexa Bliss</strong></h2><p>Alexa Bliss is a young and extremely beautiful professional wrestler signed to the WWE and is currently the SmackDown Women's Champion. This girl is both beautiful and tough, a combination in women that has the power to drive any man crazy. Alexa's real name is Alexis Kaufman, and one of the reasons she is so fit is that she has been involved in competitive sports all through her life, participating in sports such as kickboxing, gymnastics, softball, and track. Alexis has battled and overcome so much in her life, including an eating disorder that threatened her life. Alexis is dating Buddy Murphy, and if you are asking yourself why on earth she is doing so, don’t worry, you are not the only one asking that question. Apparently, these two are engaged, and will very soon tie the knot. Buddy is clearly dating a woman out of his league, and he loves every minute of it.</p><h2 id=1-dean-ambrose-and-renee-young><strong>1. Dean Ambrose and Renee Young</strong></h2><p>The moment you lay eyes on Renee Young, you will immediately realize just how lucky <a href=#>Dean Ambrose</a> is to be dating such a beauty. Renee's real name is Renee Paquette and she is a sports broadcaster and actress hailing from Canada but currently working with the WWE as a commentator and interviewer. The fact that Renee was a child model is saying enough concerning how smashing hot she is, and her confidence, beautiful face, humor, and sense of style are enough to convince you that she is way above Dean Ambrose's league. Dean is not a bad guy and is definitely a good wrestler, but looking at just how hot Renee is, you can't help but ask yourself how on earth these two are together. Although these two seem to have a strong relationship that began back in 2013, Dean had better put a ring on that finger before another man whisks Renee away.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Sources</strong>: <a href=#>wwe.com</a>, <a href=#>onlineworldofwrestling.com</a>, <a href=#>heavy.com</a>, <a href=#>pwpix.net</a>, <a href=#>fabwags.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>prowrestling.wikia.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6toaWVixLixjKysqZ2iqMGivtJmrqGnXZa%2FpnnDmquippdixLC5xKdkqK2kYrynedOhnKKqXaGyorPUnmY%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2f15-wwe-superstars-who-are-dating-women-out-of-their-league.html&title=15%20WWE%20Superstars%20Who%20Are%20Dating%20Women%20Out%20Of%20Their%20League" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-wwe-superstars-who-are-dating-women-out-of-their-league.html&description=15%20WWE%20Superstars%20Who%20Are%20Dating%20Women%20Out%20Of%20Their%20League" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-wwe-superstars-who-are-dating-women-out-of-their-league.html&title=15%20WWE%20Superstars%20Who%20Are%20Dating%20Women%20Out%20Of%20Their%20League" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2f15-wwe-superstars-who-are-dating-women-out-of-their-league.html&title=15%20WWE%20Superstars%20Who%20Are%20Dating%20Women%20Out%20Of%20Their%20League" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2f15-wwe-superstars-who-are-dating-women-out-of-their-league.html&text=15%20WWE%20Superstars%20Who%20Are%20Dating%20Women%20Out%20Of%20Their%20League" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2f15-wwe-superstars-who-are-dating-women-out-of-their-league.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Aldo Pusey</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-05-19</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./ben-mintz-wiki.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Ben Mintz Wiki: Age, Family, Height, Career, Biography, Net Worth &amp;amp; More</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./mom-influencers-instagram.html><h3>15 Most Popular Mom Influencers On Instagram Every Mother Should Know In 2023 >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
